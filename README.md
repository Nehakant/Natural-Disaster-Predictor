# Natural-Disaster-Predictor
This project is an attempt to predict natural disasters using Deep Learning

Predicting and Managing Natural disasters

Every year we lose numerous precious lives due to floods, earthquakes, landslides, cloud burts, tsunamis and other natural disasters. A lot of damage is done to peoplesâ€™ lives. The propertly loss, displacement, mainteneance, relocating and other things are a only the beginnning of the post disaster effects..

What if we could predict these before hand? What if we could put proper systems in place to detect them when they occur resulting in quick response? What if we could create a proper relocation network in place post disaster to strive and bring back to things back to where it all started?

In order to achieve this, we go back to the very important tool, Data Analytics. 

Using Mchine learning and deep learning frame works, we want to assess the various different parameters that can contribute to help us in skething out the pattern of the occurence of these disasters and to put proper tools like a handy and compactible mobile application in peoples hands to empower them into bringing into the network of disaster prediction and relocation. 

We are trying to implement:

1) Cloud burst and moisture development pattern
2) Earthquake and landslike pattern 
3) Flood pattern
4) Storm pattern
5) A news interface for people around the world to know these onging disasters
6) A crowd funding platform for disaster relief
7) A fast dial interface for the control rooms of disaster relief camps
8) A gps sos for quick sending of location for discovery and rescuel
9) The topological features of a place  based on what people think about it, mined from social interfaces
10) A hazard zone mapping with state of the art technologies and methods

We specifically want to tailor this approach for the Indian scenario, because we have a basic understanding of what region faces what problems. But since we havent found the *_required datasets_*, we plan to train it from differnet sources data from around the world and later tailor it to the local Indian features based on that result.

We exclusively use data mining and machine learning on the mined data. As an extension we would also want to assess the quality of predictions based on data from social media. Also a major aspect that we plan to implement is the application on neural networks for prediction in cases like India where not much of data is availabale and prediction based on Satellite imagery and cnn.

We in this project want to
1) Build a data warehouse for earthquake data in India and predict earthquakes based on time series with fuzzy rules. We also want to predict the magnitude which basically decides if its going to be a disaster or not based on swarm optimization and neural netowrks. The data source for this is going to be seismic database. We also plan to apply feature generation and clustering onto this data.
2) We want to build a model to find susceptible flood regions based on logistic regression and wavelet transform, through which we plan to include special features like deforestation and land feature gradient, like it caused in kerala
3) Based on this data, we want to see if we can sketch out these features directly to predict landslides with svm.
4) As a signature idea, we want to use the satellite images from the earth space observatory to find cloud and sea current pattern in addition to wind and storm pattern and apply cnn to the imges, thus implementaing deeplearning libraries in training,  training of which will also include historical meteroelogical data, to sketch out  a hybrid system based on both real time feed and history of cloud patterns and ocean currents.
5) As an extension we want to use twitter data and data mining to predict and fast detect natural disasters, as a pure data mining and integration in machine learning implementaion. We have planned to use geo tags to asses the dynamism of public in a paricular region and their readiness to natural disasters.

Seismological, Hydrological and geological datasets are paid. So we try open sources for remote sensing data and google mapping data and data sets for other countries which are free.
Twitter data for point 5 is available from ```twitter archive source``` and ```twitter apis.```
